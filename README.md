Welcome to my software engineering portfolio! I'm Birinder, a final year Computer Engineering student with a passion for coding. Over the past few years, I've learned and developed a wide range of skills, from desktop development to artificial intelligence to machine learning.

In this portfolio, you'll find a collection of my projects, from personal projects to projects I worked on for class. I've also included a section on my skills and experience, so you can get a better sense of what I'm capable of.

I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio! If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me at my socials.
